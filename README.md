# Library_Management
To run the code we need to directly put all the dependencies (which I have mentioned in the System Requirements parts) and then run the Main class main function and UI will start.
After Running main function I have already inserted the username and Password for admin which is USERNAME: - ADMIN and PASSWORD: -  ADMIN (both case insensitive)
After entering to the admin mode, you can see the different functionality.
System Requirements
To execute the below project, you will need the following business requirements:
•	MySQL Community Server
•	MySQL JDBC Connector
•	Java
•	INTELIIiJ
•	rs2xml.jar
The rs2xml jar is used to display the data in a table format. So, once you create a project in Eclipse IDE, you have to import the rs2xml jar and JDBC connector JAR into the project.
To do that, right-click on the project, choose Build Path -> Configure Build Path. In the dialog box, which opens, choose Add External JARs, and add the JAR files.
