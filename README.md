# Library_Management<br />
To run the code we need to directly put all the dependencies (which I have mentioned in the System Requirements parts) and then run the Main class main function and UI will start.<br />
After Running main function I have already inserted the username and Password for admin which is USERNAME: - ADMIN and PASSWORD: -  ADMIN (both case insensitive)<br />
After entering to the admin mode, you can see the different functionality.<br />
System Requirements<br />
To execute the below project, you will need the following business requirements:<br />
•	MySQL Community Server<br />
•	MySQL JDBC Connector<br />
•	Java<br />
•	INTELIIiJ<br />
•	rs2xml.jar<br />
The rs2xml jar is used to display the data in a table format. So, once you create a project in Eclipse IDE, you have to import the rs2xml jar and JDBC connector JAR into the project.<br />
To do that, right-click on the project, choose Build Path -> Configure Build Path. In the dialog box, which opens, choose Add External JARs, and add the JAR files.<br />
